    "1.Dimensionality Reduction:\n",
    "Anomaly detection often benefits from reducing the number of features (variables) used for analysis. High-dimensional data can be challenging\n",
    "to work with and may lead to the curse of dimensionality, where the data becomes sparse and computational complexity increases. Feature \n",

    "The choice of epsilon represents a trade-off between precision (the ability to correctly identify true anomalies) and recall (the ability to\n",
